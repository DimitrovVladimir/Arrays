# Arrays

With solving this problems, I practice working with Arrays.

## Problem: Fold and Sum 

Read an array of 4*k integers, fold it like shown below, and print the sum of the upper and lower two rows (each holding 2 * k integers):
Look screenshot 1:
### Example:
#### input:
5 2 3 6
#### output:
7 9

## Problem: Largest Common End

Read two arrays of words and find the length of the largest common end (left or right).

### Example:
#### input:
hi php java csharp sql html css js

hi php java js pithon hml java learn

#### output:
3

## Problem: Max Sequence of Equal Elements

Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of integers. If several longest sequences exist, print the leftmost one.


### Example:
#### input:
2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1
#### output:
2 2 2

## Problem: Rotate and Sum
To “rotate an array on the right” means to move its last element first: {1, 2, 3} => {3, 1, 2}.
Write a program to read an array of n integers (space separated on a single line) and an integer k, rotate the array right k times and sum the obtained arrays after each rotation as shown below

### Example:
#### input:
3 2 4 -1

2
#### output:
3 2 5 6

## Problem: Sieve of Eratosthenes

Write a program to find all prime numbers in range [1…n]. Implement the algorithm called “Sieve of Eratosthenes”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes.

### Example:
#### input:
25
#### output:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23
